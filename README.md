# TidyTuesday

![]()

This is the repo for all of my #TidyTuesday contributions. Each folder contains some example visualizations and the code I wrote to create them. So far, I have worked on the following data sets:
  <ol>
    <li> Deforestation in Brazil (Week 15 / 2021), created treemaps to show the break up of forest area loss into different reasons, data from <a href= "https://ourworldindata.org/">Our World in Data</a></li>
  </ol>
