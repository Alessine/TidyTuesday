This is the repository for all of my contributions to #TidyTuesday, an initiative by the [R4DS online learning community](https://www.rfordatasci.com/). All the data and related articles can be found in the official [#TidyTuesday github repo](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).

Each of the folders in this repository contains some example visualizations and the code I wrote to create them. So far, I have worked on the following data sets:

## April 2021
### Week 15 - Deforestation in Brazil
I created treemaps to show the break up of forest area loss by its different drivers in the years 2001-2013. I then used the gifski library to animate the png files and compile them into one gif. The data was provided by [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/").
