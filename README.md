This is the repository for all of my contributions to #TidyTuesday, an initiative by the [R4DS online learning community](https://www.rfordatasci.com/). All the data and related articles can be found in the official [#TidyTuesday github repo](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).

Each of the folders in this repository contains some example visualizations and the code I wrote to create them. So far, I have worked on the following data sets:
  <ol>
    <li> Deforestation in Brazil (Week 15 / 2021), created treemaps to show the break up of forest area loss into different reasons, the data was provided by <a href= "https://ourworldindata.org/">Our World in Data</a></li>
  </ol>
